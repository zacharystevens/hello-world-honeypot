# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Advanced Honeypot Security System. ADRs document the key architectural decisions made during development, including context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

## ADR Index

### Core Architecture
- **[ADR-001: Modular Architecture Refactoring](001-modular-architecture.md)** ✅  
  *Decision to refactor monolithic Lambda into modular SOLID-compliant architecture*

- **[ADR-002: Threat Detection Engine Design](002-threat-detection-engine.md)** ✅  
  *Design of comprehensive threat detection and analysis system*

### Implementation Decisions
- **ADR-003: Response Generation Strategy** 📋 *[Planned]*  
  *Strategy pattern implementation for honeypot response generation*

- **ADR-004: Logging and Monitoring Architecture** 📋 *[Planned]*  
  *Structured logging and comprehensive monitoring system design*

- **ADR-005: Configuration Management** 📋 *[Planned]*  
  *Centralized configuration and environment-specific settings*

### Security Decisions
- **ADR-006: Input Validation Strategy** 📋 *[Planned]*  
  *Request validation and sanitization approach*

- **ADR-007: Data Retention and Privacy** 📋 *[Planned]*  
  *Log retention policies and PII handling*

### Performance Decisions
- **ADR-008: Lambda Optimization** 📋 *[Planned]*  
  *Cold start optimization and performance tuning*

- **ADR-009: Scaling Strategy** 📋 *[Planned]*  
  *Auto-scaling and rate limiting implementation*

# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed|Accepted|Rejected|Superseded]  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: [List of people involved]  
**Relates to**: [Links to related ADRs]

## Context
[Describe the situation and problem being addressed]

## Decision
[Describe the chosen solution and approach]

## Consequences
### Positive:
- [Benefits of this decision]

### Negative:
- [Drawbacks and challenges]

### Mitigation:
- [How negative consequences are addressed]

## Alternatives Considered
### Alternative 1: [Name]
**Pros**: [Benefits]  
**Cons**: [Drawbacks]  
**Decision**: [Accepted/Rejected] - [Reason]

## Implementation Details
[Technical specifics and code examples]

## Validation
[How the decision was tested and validated]

## Future Considerations
[What might change in the future]
```

## ADR Status Legend

- ✅ **Accepted**: Decision implemented and in use
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Currently being implemented
- 📋 **Planned**: Scheduled for future implementation
- ❌ **Rejected**: Decision not to proceed
- 🔄 **Superseded**: Replaced by newer ADR

## Contributing to ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Have significant architectural impact
- Affect multiple components or team members  
- Involve trade-offs between alternatives
- Set precedent for future decisions
- Change existing architectural patterns

### ADR Review Process
1. **Draft**: Create ADR in `Proposed` status
2. **Review**: Team discussion and feedback
3. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or request changes
4. **Implementation**: Update status to `Accepted`
5. **Validation**: Confirm decision works as expected

### Updating ADRs
- **Status Changes**: Update status as implementation progresses
- **Consequences**: Add lessons learned during implementation
- **Related Decisions**: Link to new ADRs that build on this one
- **Superseding**: Mark as superseded when replaced
